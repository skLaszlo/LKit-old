                                 [g:3][g:0][g:3] 
After many hours of hard labor and learning multiple programs, I present to you [c/ddf221:LKit] version 1!

[c/ddf221:LKit currently includes:]
[g:5] 4 tools
[g:5] 3 crafting materials
[g:5] 2 guns
[g:5] 1 (WIP) vanity item (unobtainable)


[c/ddf221:An early game hamaxe?!]
[i:3518] + [i:3517] + [i:9] = [c/8789c6:Caution!]
- 55% hammer power
- 55% axe power
On top of that, the [c/8789c6:Caution!] hamaxe can be upgraded later in hardmode! No spoilers!

[c/ddf221:Some guns are also present:]
[c/8789c6:UZM]
- 7 ranged damage
- 5% crit chance
Similarly to the hamaxes, the [c/8789c6:UZM] can also be upgraded in hardmode. You just have to use some circuitry!

[c/FF0000:What's next?]
I want to continue adding more items and weapons to this mod pack. I have at least one pet idea in mind as well. Hopefully as I improve my modding skills I can create better and better things! Something else to keep in mind is that I'm trying to have every item scale appropriately with how the game normally progresses.

[c/FF0000:Further info]
